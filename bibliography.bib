	abstract = {Single image 3D reconstruction is an important but challenging task that requires extensive knowledge of our natural world. Many existing methods solve this problem by optimizing a neural radiance field under the guidance of 2D diffusion models but suffer from lengthy optimization time, 3D inconsistency results, and poor geometry. In this work, we propose a novel method that takes a single image of any object as input and generates a full 360-degree 3D textured mesh in a single feed-forward pass. Given a single image, we first use a view-conditioned 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to generate multi-view images for the input view, and then aim to lift them up to 3D space. Since traditional reconstruction methods struggle with inconsistent multi-view predictions, we build our 3D reconstruction module upon an {SDF}-based generalizable neural surface reconstruction method and propose several critical training strategies to enable the reconstruction of 360degree meshes. Without costly optimizations, our method reconstructs 3D shapes in significantly less time than existing methods. Moreover, our method favors better geometry, generates more 3D consistent results, and adheres more closely to the input image. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic data and in-the-wild images and demonstrate its superiority in terms of both mesh quality and runtime. In addition, our approach can seamlessly support the text-to-3D task by integrating with off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models.},

In contrast to many previous methods that are trained on small-scale datasets such as {ShapeNet} in a category-specific fashion, {LRM} adopts a highly scalable transformer-based architecture with 500 million learnable parameters to directly predict a neural radiance field ({NeRF}) from the input image. We train our model in an end-to-end manner on massive multi-view data containing around 1 million objects, including both synthetic renderings from Objaverse and real captures from {MVImgNet}. This combination of a high-capacity model and large-scale training data empowers our model to be highly generalizable and produce high-quality 3D reconstructions from various testing inputs, including real-world in-the-wild captures and images created by generative models.

Our dataset comprises deduplicated 3D objects from a diverse set of sources, including manually designed objects, photogrammetry scans of landmarks and everyday items, and professional scans of historic and antique artifacts. Representing the largest scale and diversity in the realm of 3D datasets, Objaverse-{XL} enables significant new possibilities for 3D vision. Our experiments demonstrate the improvements enabled with the scale provided by Objaverse-{XL}. We show that by training Zero123 on novel view synthesis, utilizing over 100 million multi-view rendered images, we achieve strong zero-shot generalization abilities. We hope that releasing Objaverse-{XL} will enable further innovations in the field of 3D vision at scale.},

Adapting this approach to 3D synthesis would require large-scale datasets of labeled 3D data and efficient architectures for denoising 3D data, neither of which currently exist. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model to perform text-to-3D synthesis. We introduce a loss based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a {DeepDream}-like procedure, we optimize a randomly-initialized 3D model (a Neural Radiance Field, or {NeRF}) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment. Our approach requires no 3D training data and no modifications to the image diffusion model, demonstrating the effectiveness of pretrained image diffusion models as priors.},

	abstract = {{DreamFusion} has recently demonstrated the utility of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to optimize Neural Radiance Fields ({NeRF}), achieving remarkable text-to-3D synthesis results. However, the method has two inherent limitations: (a) extremely slow optimization of {NeRF} and (b) low-resolution image space supervision on {NeRF}, leading to low-quality 3D models with a long processing time. In this paper, we address these limitations by utilizing a two-stage optimization framework. First, we obtain a coarse model using a low-resolution diffusion prior and accelerate with a sparse 3D hash grid structure. Using the coarse representation as the initialization, we further optimize a textured 3D mesh model with an efficient differentiable renderer interacting with a high-resolution latent diffusion model. Our method, dubbed Magic3D, can create high quality 3D mesh models in 40 minutes, which is 2x faster than {DreamFusion} (reportedly taking 1.5 hours on average), while also achieving higher resolution. User studies show 61.7\% raters to prefer our approach over {DreamFusion}. Together with the image-conditioned generation capabilities, we provide users with new ways to control 3D synthesis, opening up new avenues to various creative applications.},

	abstract = {We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method, called {NeuS}, for reconstructing objects and scenes with high fidelity from 2D image inputs. Existing neural surface reconstruction approaches, such as {DVR} and {IDR}, require foreground mask as supervision, easily get trapped in local minima, and therefore struggle with the reconstruction of objects with severe self-occlusion or thin structures. Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel view synthesis, such as {NeRF} and its variants, use volume rendering to produce a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly complex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned implicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface constraints in the representation. In {NeuS}, we propose to represent a surface as the zero-level set of a signed distance function ({SDF}) and develop a new volume rendering method to train a neural {SDF} representation. We observe that the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e. bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments on the {DTU} dataset and the {BlendedMVS} dataset show that {NeuS} outperforms the state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for objects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.},

The multiresolution structure allows the network to disambiguate hash collisions, making for a simple architecture that is trivial to parallelize on modern {GPUs}. We leverage this parallelism by implementing the whole system using fully-fused {CUDA} kernels with a focus on minimizing wasted bandwidth and compute operations.

	abstract = {The image of the world projected onto the retina is essentially two-dimensional. From this image we recover information about the shapes of objects in a three-dimensional world. How is this done? 

The answer lies in part in the variation of brightness, or shading, often exhibited in a region of an image. In a photograph of a face, for example, there are variations in brightness, even though the reflecting properties of the skin presumably do not vary much from place to place. It may be concluded that shading effects arise primarily because some parts of a surface are oriented so as to reflect more of the incident light toward the viewer than are others.

It should be pointed out right away that the recovery of shape from shading is by no means trivial. We cannot simply associate a given image brightness with a particular surface orientation. The problem is that there are two degrees of freedom to surface orientation - it takes two numbers to specify the direction of a unit vector perpendicular to the surface. Since we have only one brightness measurement at each picture cell, we have one equation in two unknowns at every point in the image. Additional constraint must therefore be brought to bear. One way to provide the needed constraint is to assume that the surface is continuous and smooth, so that the surface orientations of neighboring surface patches are not independent.

Note that there is no magic at work here: we are not recovering a function of three variables given only a function of two variables. The distribution of some absorbing material in three-dimensional space cannot be recovered from a single two-dimensional projection. The techniques of tomographic reconstruction can be applied to that problem, but only if a large number of images taken from many different viewpoints are available. Why then are we able to learn so much about the three-dimensional world from merely two-dimensional images?},

Stereopsis is implemented as a match, expand, and filter procedure, starting from a sparse set of matched keypoints, and repeatedly expanding these before using visibility constraints to filter away false matches. The keys to the performance of the proposed algorithm are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints. Simple but effective methods are also proposed to turn the resulting patch model into a mesh which can be further refined by an algorithm that enforces both photometric consistency and regularization constraints. The proposed approach automatically detects and discards outliers and obstacles and does not require any initialization in the form of a visual hull, a bounding box, or valid depth ranges. We have tested our algorithm on various data sets including objects with fine surface details, deep concavities, and thin structures, outdoor scenes observed from a restricted set of viewpoints, and “crowded” scenes where moving obstacles appear in front of a static structure of interest. A quantitative evaluation on the Middlebury benchmark [1] shows that the proposed method outperforms all others submitted so far for four out of the six data sets.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient {GPU} implementation of convolutional nets. To reduce overfitting in the globally connected layers we employed a new regularization method that proved to be very effective.},

In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named {PointNet}, provides a uniﬁed architecture for applications ranging from object classiﬁcation, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, {PointNet} is highly efﬁcient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

In this work, we introduce {DeepSDF}, a learned continuous Signed Distance Function ({SDF}) representation of a class of shapes that enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completion from partial and noisy 3D input data. {DeepSDF}, like its classical counterpart, represents a shape’s surface by a continuous volumetric ﬁeld: the magnitude of a point in the ﬁeld represents the distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape, hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape’s boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the classiﬁcation of space as being part of the shapes’ interior or not. While classical {SDF}’s both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, {DeepSDF} can represent an entire class of shapes. Furthermore, we show stateof-the-art performance for learned 3D shape representation and completion while reducing the model size by an order of magnitude compared with previous work.},

Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully connected (nonconvolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x, y, z) and viewing direction (θ, ϕ)) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis.},

The question addressed is how the three dimen­sional structure and motion of objects can be inferred from the two dimensional transformations of their projected images when no three dimensional information is conveyed by the individual projections. The following scheme is proposed: (i) divide the image into groups of four elements each; (ii) test each group for a rigid interpretation; (iii) combine the results obtained in (ii). It is shown that this scheme will correctly decompose scenes containing arbitrary rigid objects in motion, recovering their three dimensional structure and motion. The analysis is based primarily on the ʻstructure from motion’ theorem which states that the structure of four non-coplanar points is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The interpretation scheme is extended to cover perspective projections, and its psychological relevance is discussed.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.},

While many previous works learn to hallucinate the shape directly from priors, we resort to further improving the shape quality by leveraging cross-view information with a graph convolutional network. Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh’s vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shape that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints. With the help of physically driven architecture, our model also exhibits generalization capability across different semantic categories, number of input images, and quality of mesh initialization.},

Contrary to prediction by Lambert's Law, diffuse reflection from smooth surfaces is significantly viewpoint dependent, and there are prominent diffuse reflection maxima effects occurring on objects when incident point source illumination is greater than 50‡ relative to viewing including the range from 90‡ to 180‡ where the light source is behind the object with respect to viewing. Presented here is a diffuse reflectance model, derived from first physical principles, utilizing results of radiative transfer theory for subsurface multiple scattering together with Fresnel attenuation and Snell refraction at a smooth air-dielectric surface boundary.

It improves the currently less-informative and insufficient 2D navigation schemes for robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery ({MIS}) to 3D navigation. Previously, a general and registration-free framework was proposed for 3D shape instantiation based on Kernel Partial Least Square Regression ({KPLSR}), requiring manually segmented anatomical structures as the pre-requisite. Two hyper-parameters including the Gaussian width and component number also need to be carefully adjusted. Deep Convolutional Neural Network ({DCNN}) based framework has also been proposed to reconstruct a 3D point cloud from a single 2D image, with end-to-end and fully automatic learning. In this paper, an Instantiation-Net is proposed to reconstruct the 3D mesh of a target from its a single 2D image, by using {DCNN} to extract features from the 2D image and Graph Convolutional Network ({GCN}) to reconstruct the 3D mesh, and using Fully Connected ({FC}) layers to connect the {DCNN} to {GCN}. Detailed validation was performed to demonstrate the practical strength of the method and its potential clinical use.},
