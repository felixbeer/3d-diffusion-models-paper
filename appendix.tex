\section{AI Methodology}

% Document in this section, how AI was utilized to support the creation of this seminar paper or thesis. Which tools were used? Which steps of the thesis creation were supported (e.g., brain storming, literature search, quality analysis of papers, text generation, text summaries, paraphrasing, spellchecking, ...). If generative AI was utilized (e.g., ChatGPT, CoPilot), also provide key text prompts that influenced the thesis.
AI was mainly used to support grammar and spelling corrections. The tools used were LanguageTool as well as ChatGPT.

\subsection{LanguageTool} % example tool
LanguageTool was used throughout the whole writing process to quickly check for spelling and grammar mistakes. It was especially helpful in the final stages of the paper to ensure that no major mistakes were left. I estimate that about 5\% of the paper was corrected by LanguageTool.

\subsection{ChatGPT}
ChatGPT was used to update some sections of the paper where I did not like the initial wording. Most of these sections were the more technical ones like \ref{section:cnns} or \ref{section:gans}.
I estimate that about 20\% of the paper was improved by ChatGPT.
Other than that ChatGPT was used at the beginning to give a brief overview of the topic and to generate a structural idea for this paper.

\subsubsection{Prompts}
The first 5 prompts were provided from the slides in the supporting course with my own addition of the passive voice correction.
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors."
    \item "Enhance clarity and coherence by rephrasing unclear or ambiguous sentences."
    \item "Ensure consistency in terminology, tense, and formatting."
    \item "Suggest more precise vocabulary without using overly complex jargon."
    \item "Trim unnecessary words or redundancies to make the text concise."
    \item "Correct any usage of passive voice."
\end{itemize}
